## Project Shape
- ESP-IDF C firmware template `ESP32WatchApp`; `app_main()` in `main/main.c` only boots; the demo app (screen, buttons, screen timeout, sleep) lives in `components/demo_app`. It is the minimal pattern every app follows.
- Target hardware is Waveshare `ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-2.06` with ESP32-S3R8, AMOLED 410x502 QSPI, FT3168 touch, QMI8658 IMU, PCF85063 RTC, AXP2101 PMU, ES8311 speaker, ES7210 dual-mic ADC, and microSD.
- Baseline stack is `ESP-IDF 5.5.4 + LVGL 9 + waveshare/esp32_s3_touch_amoled_2_06` BSP. Do not migrate to ESP-IDF 6.x or ESP-Brookesia unless explicitly requested.
- Shared board services (`watch_display.h`, `watch_power.h`, `watch_buttons.h`, `watch_battery.h`, `watch_rtc.h`, `watch_nvs.h`, `watch_launcher.h`, `imu_service.h`) come from `watch_board` in https://github.com/Sethyrus/ESP32Watch-core, pinned by tag in `main/idf_component.yml` (v0.5.1). Hardware docs live in that repo's `docs/`. Core fixes are propagated to every app in the same batch (core `AGENTS.md`, "Alineacion De Repos").
- Keep `main` small: app logic goes in `components/<app>_app` (`REQUIRES watch_board lvgl`).
- Launcher mode: `watch_launcher_boot_once()` stays first in `app_main`; offer exit (`watch_launcher_exit()`) only when `watch_launcher_is_available()`. NVS is shared by every app: init it with `watch_nvs_init()`, use an own namespace, never erase it.
- `partitions.csv` is the shared layout owned by ESP32Watch-Launcher; do not change offsets here.
- Power: the screen timeout and sleep go through `watch_power_sleep()` / `watch_power_screen_off()`, called from a task that does not hold the LVGL lock (here `system_task`). They also disable the touch while asleep; an app that sleeps on its own must copy that (core `docs/GOTCHAS.md`, "Tactil En Sleep"). Call `watch_power_quiet_peripherals()` at boot.
- Never write AXP2101 power or protection registers; read core `docs/PMU_SAFETY.md` before any PMU access.
- Durable project config lives in `sdkconfig.defaults`, `partitions.csv`, component manifests and `dependencies.lock`. `sdkconfig`, `build/`, and `managed_components/` are generated/local.

## Commands
- Source ESP-IDF: `source "$HOME/.espressif/tools/activate_idf_v5.5.4.sh"` (EIM install; otherwise core `docs/SETUP.md`).
- First setup or fresh config: `idf.py set-target esp32s3`.
- Build/primary verification: `idf.py build`.
- Flash and monitor: `idf.py -p <PORT> flash monitor` (macOS port looks like `/dev/tty.usbmodem*` and changes with the USB socket; `idf.py` auto-detects it if `-p` is omitted).
- No repo-local test, lint, or format targets are configured; do not invent npm/PlatformIO/pytest commands.

## Hardware And BSP Notes
- Display, touch and LVGL: always `watch_display_start()` from core, never `bsp_display_start()` (it registers the QSPI panel as RGB: heap overrun). Prefer the Waveshare BSP for audio, SD and I2C.
- The wiki mentions display controller `CO5300`, but the ESP-IDF BSP uses `waveshare/esp_lcd_sh8601`. Treat the BSP as source of truth.
- Display brightness is command `0x51` over QSPI, exposed as `bsp_display_brightness_set(percent)`.
- LVGL is not thread-safe. Wrap all `lv_*` calls made outside LVGL callbacks/tasks with `bsp_display_lock()` and `bsp_display_unlock()`.
- Reuse `bsp_i2c_get_handle()` for devices on the shared I2C bus; do not create a second master bus on the same port.
- BOOT is GPIO0, active low. PWR is not a GPIO: it goes to AXP2101 `PWRON` (short press via `watch_pwr_key_take_short_press()`); holding it ~6 s powers off the board.
- Button convention: BOOT = accept/primary action, PWR short press = back/menu. See "Convencion De Botones" in core `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- For microSD use BSP SDMMC 1-bit (`CLK GPIO2`, `CMD GPIO1`, `D0 GPIO3`). `GPIO17` appears only in Arduino SPI-style SD examples.
- QMI8658 accel is milli-g; `imu_service` already maps axes as `screen_x = -accelY / 1000`, `screen_y = accelX / 1000`.
- There is no vibration motor (`GPIO18` does nothing; core `docs/BRINGUP.md`). Schematic-only pins not wrapped by BSP include QMI INT `GPIO21`, RTC INT `GPIO39`, LCD TE `GPIO13`, `SYS_OUT/GPIO10`; verify before use.
- For I2C scans, ES7210 appears as `0x40` 7-bit even though `esp_codec_dev` uses an `0x80` default-address macro.

## Working Rules
- Do not commit, tag or push unless the user asks.
- Never leave a test or benchmark firmware flashed on the watch without saying so.
